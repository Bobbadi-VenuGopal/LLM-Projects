# Project 1: Basic Text Generation

## Overview
Learn to generate text using a local LLM. This is your first step into the world of LLMs!

## What You'll Learn
- How to load a pre-trained language model
- Basic text generation techniques
- Understanding model parameters (temperature, max_length, etc.)

## Model Used
- **TinyLlama-1.1B** (~600MB) - Fast and lightweight

## How to Run

```bash
cd 01_basic_text_generation
python text_generation.py
```

## Customization
- Try different prompts
- Adjust temperature (0.1 to 1.0) to control randomness
- Change max_length to generate longer/shorter text

## Example Output
```
Input: "The future of AI is"
Output: "The future of AI is bright and full of possibilities. 
         As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see 
         more innovative applications..."
```
