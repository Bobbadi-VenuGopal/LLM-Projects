# Project 4: Prompt Engineering

## Overview
Learn effective prompt engineering techniques to get better results from LLMs.

## What You'll Learn
- Different prompt templates
- Few-shot learning
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Prompt optimization strategies

## Model Used
- **Phi-2** (~1.6GB) - Microsoft's small but powerful model

## How to Run

```bash
cd 04_prompt_engineering
python prompt_engineering.py
```

## Techniques Covered
1. **Zero-shot** - Direct questions
2. **Few-shot** - Examples in prompt
3. **Chain-of-thought** - Step-by-step reasoning
4. **Role-based** - Assigning roles to the AI
5. **Template prompts** - Structured formats

## Example
```
Zero-shot: "What is the capital of France?"
Few-shot: "France -> Paris, Germany -> Berlin, Italy -> ?"
Chain-of-thought: "Let's think step by step. To solve this problem..."
```
