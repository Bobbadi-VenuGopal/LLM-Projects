# Project 10: Fine-tuning LLMs

## Overview
Learn to fine-tune a small LLM on custom data for specific tasks.

## What You'll Learn
- Fine-tuning process
- Preparing training data
- Training loops
- Model evaluation
- Saving and loading fine-tuned models

## Model Used
- **TinyLlama-1.1B** - Base model for fine-tuning

## Important Notes
- Fine-tuning requires significant computational resources
- This example uses a simplified approach suitable for learning
- For production, use proper training frameworks (Trainer API, PEFT, LoRA)

## How to Run

```bash
cd 10_fine_tuning
python fine_tune.py
```

## Features
- Prepare custom dataset
- Fine-tune on specific task
- Evaluate fine-tuned model
- Save and load model

## Example Tasks
- Sentiment analysis fine-tuning
- Domain-specific language model
- Custom chatbot personality
